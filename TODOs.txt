Better stop on correct + fix "pop" animation

Final level
Finishing screen

Fix circle motion to be less juddery

Feedback:
- frustration around not getting it in right / stop on correct
- auto select
- start blue then red? + phrasing around "ripe" clue/instructions

Make all the polygons textured a la paper

add visual focus/active indicator

sfx!

make intersection building lazy - spawn on enter/recycle on exit
- keep iteration the same though

more to do on final level
